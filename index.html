            Hello, I am Nicholas Schenk, but I go by Nick. I grew up in Macomb MI, graduated high school from Dakota High School, and then enrolled at Macomb Community College. 
            I am currently employed at a construction supply company called R.S. Dale. This was my first job I have had and I am still going strong there. 
            For a brief time before attending OU, I had also worked a second job at a restaurant, and quickly found out that restaurant work was not for me. 
            After 2 years at MCC, I transferred to Oakland persuing a degree in Biomedical Engiineering, come to find out later that Calculus 2 was also not for me.
            So I switched majors, and now am following a path to get a bachelors degree in Bioinformatics, which is an IT degree with a focus on biology.
            If you would like to know a little bit more about myself check out my <a href="./html/my_resume.html">resume page</a> and my <a href="./html/my_fun_facts.html">fun facts page</a>!
