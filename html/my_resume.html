        <h3>&Tab;Professional Experience</h3>
        <h4>
            Start Date: Nov 2016. End Date: N/A. Job Role: Warehouse/Hardware Manager. Company: R.S. Dale co. inc. Location: Sterling Heights, MI.
        </h4>
        <p>
            A member of the warehouse should have the knowledge of not only where in the building a product is, but how the product is used outside of the building. 
            This also includes being able to package, label, and send out the products efficiently. As hardware manager I am in charge of all things like hex nuts, bolts, screws, and other similar items.
            I have to package, order, and sort out thousands of pounds of products to be able to efficiently stock our building for customers to buy.
        </p>

        <h4>
            Start Date: July 2018. End Date: Dec 2018. Job Role: Host. Company: Red Ox Tavern. Location: Utica
        </h4>
        <p>
            As a host at Red Ox Tavern, I was in charge of seating customers, creating a flow chart for the servers to follow for their tables, take to-go orders, and most importantly be smiling as I was the first face you saw in the building.
